# Summary

This is a proof of concept integration between a GitHub [@GitHub] repo and figshare [@figshare] in an effort to get a DOI for a GitHub repository. When a repository is tagged for release on GitHub, Fidgit [@Fidgit] will import the release into figshare thus giving the code bundle a DOI. In a somewhat meta fashion, Fidgit is publishing itself to figshare with DOI 'http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.828487' [@figshare_archive].
